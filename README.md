# Predicting-T20-Cricket-Scores-using-Machine-Learning-An-Evaluation-of-Six-Different-Algorithms

## About the project

The Current Run Rate (CRR) method is currently used to predict the final score in T20 cricket matches.
This method involves multiplying the average runs scored in an over by the total number of overs. However, this approach is not
effective for T20 matches, where the match can rapidly change within a few overs, regardless of the current run rate. To accurately
predict the score, a more efficient system is needed. Given that many people enjoy watching cricket and predicting the final score,
this project aims to develop an accurate prediction system for live T20 International matches. We consider various
factors that can impact the score prediction and utilize the available previous matches data to achieve a more accurate prediction
